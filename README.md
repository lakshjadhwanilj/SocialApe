# SocialApe
A social media web app built with React (styled with Material-UI) and Firebase.<br />
A basic web app built covering the basic functionalities of react and Firebase.<br />
A user needs to sign up with email and password to use the app.<br />
After signing up, he/she can post photos and add comments to posts.<br />

This project still needs a lot of updations, like code refraction and adding features like the Like Post functionality.
